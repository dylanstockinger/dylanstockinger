### Junior developer ! ðŸ‘‹

At 24 years old, I decided to leave my job  :balance_scale: to go into what I'm really passionate about, computer science. **I started a 6 months intensive developer training at @O'clock.**  
  
During these **6 months** I was able to acquire solid bases and to **launch myself in a concrete project** : an **application** which tries to approach a solution to the organizations (proposing an activity like) and to the users (eager to venture in a new sporting or creative experiment) by creating a centralized platform, intuitive and easy to learn to **facilitate the interoperability of the exchanges associations-users**. :guitar: :soccer:	  
  
Currently, I am looking for an internship for the month of January 7, 2003 and a **alterned training** for **April 3, 2023** :fire: .
