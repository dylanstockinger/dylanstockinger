### Hey there ! 👋

At 24 years old, I decided to leave my job  :balance_scale: to go into what I'm really passionate about, computer science. **I started a 6 months intensive developer training at @O'clock.**  

During these 6 intensive months, I was able to learn what the world of the web really was, I was also able to discipline myself and acquire a good knowledge.

Following the theory part, **we had a month** where I was able to embark on the creation of a **solid application**, which offers cooking recipes and the possibility of creating new recipes and sharing them 🍪 🥘 . **I have only one desire: to develop my knowledge**.

Currently looking for an **apprenticeship contract** for **April 2023** 🔥
